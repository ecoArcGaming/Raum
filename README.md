# Raum
Originally inspired by co-designers at the MIT Assistive Tech Club, this app is built to navigate visually-inpaired users to certain objects using spatial sound. 

It includes accessibility features such as
- text-to-speech input
- voice-over during object recognition 
- spatial hints for locating (supports the apple Dynamic Head Tracking feature on applicable devices)
- start-over with gesture

It is built with a simple iOS native pipeline, integrating coreML, ARkit, and NLEmbedding.
